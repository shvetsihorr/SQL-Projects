# SQL-Projects

This SQL query aggregates daily performance data for ad campaigns from the facebook_ads_basic_daily table. It calculates key metrics including total spend, impressions, clicks, and value, as well as Cost Per Click (CPC), Cost Per Thousand Impressions (CPM), Click-Through Rate (CTR), and Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI). Results are grouped by date and campaign ID, with metrics rounded to the nearest whole number or two decimal places as appropriate.
