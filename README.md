## Project 1: Daily Campaign Performance Metrics
This SQL query aggregates daily performance data for ad campaigns from the facebook_ads_basic_daily table. It calculates key metrics including total spend, impressions, clicks, and value, as well as Cost Per Click (CPC), Cost Per Thousand Impressions (CPM), Click-Through Rate (CTR), and Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI). Results are grouped by date and campaign ID, with metrics rounded to the nearest whole number or two decimal places as appropriate.

## Project 2: Combining Facebook and Google Ads Data
In this project, I used SQL to combine data from two tables, facebook_ads_basic_daily and google_ads_basic_daily, using a Common Table Expression (CTE). The query aggregates metrics for ad campaigns from both sources by date and media source. The key metrics include total spend, impressions, clicks, and conversion value. This approach provides a unified view of ad performance across platforms.
